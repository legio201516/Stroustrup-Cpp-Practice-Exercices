# Exercises from "Programming – Principles and Practice using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup
Below are my implementations of the exercices from "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++".

## Tech Stack & Environment

Editor: VS Code v1.107.1

Build System: CMake v4.2.0-rc4

Compiler Toolchain: MinGW-w64 (GNU Make 4.4.1)

Language Standard: C++11/17 (via GCC)

## Project Structure
Chapters 1–11: Fundamental concepts, types, objects, and error handling.

Chapters 17–27: Advanced data structures, vectors, and memory management.

Note on Chapters 12–16: These chapters focus primarily on GUI (Graphical User Interface) libraries. You can see I have chosen to skip these to focus on core language logic and systems programming.
